People, inside your browser.

## Summary ##

Rapport is a web application that allows users to spontaneously meet other people based on location. Our map feature allows you to first choose a location and then join a group chat with people also interested in that place. If you're feeling adventurous, hit "I'm feeling lucky!" to be matched in a private chat with a random nearby user.

## Problem ##

You find yourself wanting to try out a new restaurant, hang out in the park, grab a drink at a bar, or check out a museum, but none of your friends are free to join you--and you don't want to go alone.

## Solution ##

Give people a simple platform for making connections based on interest and location.

## How to Get Started ##

Sign in and meet up with nearby people right away.
